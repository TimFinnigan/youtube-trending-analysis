On this occasion, they will hold a Moonlight festival at [12:00], when the moon shines the brightest‚Äîa festival where no girl will feel silenced.\n\nLOOŒ†Œî makes coincidence when destiny collides with fate, and finds her destiny within coincidence and fate to deliver a new message for the Midnight Festival.\n \n ‚ÄòWith all LOOŒ†Œîs around the world‚Äô, all of the LOOŒ†Œîs across the globe will always be together, where all are dignified, equal and worthy of freedom. \nThe united voices of the girls around the world rings loud and clear ahead of the start of the new moon.\n \nIntro for the album which is ‚Äô12:00‚Äô, it is promised time in the new space, capturing our story of getting into orbit.\n\nThe titled track ‚ÄòWhy Not?‚Äô is an uptempo electronic pop song, with a story of pursuing freedom and individualistic self. The funky and bubbly bass line reminiscent of the Midnight Festival is impressive. The key change in the song, which started with a charismatic introduction, from the chorus to the witty major, it resembles LOOŒ†Œî who is about to change.\n \n‚ÄòVoice‚Äô is an energetic retro song with a low, repetitive beat that evokes addiction. It is meant to enjoy the feelings of love and to venture together in an uncontrollable excitement.\n \n‚ÄòFall Again‚Äô has a story about falling back in love with the one every time fall returns. It is a Pop R&B, a harmonious blend of sentimental vocals and rhythmic instruments by LOOŒ†Œî. It gives the feeling of the seasonality of autumn abundant.\n \n ‚ÄòUniverse‚Äô is a dreamy up-tempo electronic pop ballad with soft sweltering pads, ambient vocals and steady beat, adding warmth to the beat of love, attraction and temptation with the piano melody, allowing you to feel the song in its entirety. \n\n ‚ÄòHide & Seek‚Äô is a cool, bright, poptastic uptempo dance song, which it coolly reveals one‚Äôs mind that is not hidden. It is showing confidence to the opponent, like playing hide & seek.\n \n ‚ÄòOOPS!‚Äô is a multi-groove pop song characterized by a cool, repetitive feeling and Latin undertones. It sends a message that the one will love oneself and live freely without caring about others anymore.\n \nIn addition, ‚ÄòStar‚Äô which is an English version of Voice, it is aimed at global fans, will be released at the same time, allowing them to enjoy various music sources.\n\nLOOŒ†Œîs [12:00] album ‚Äî where LOOŒ†Œî creates the inevitable through the merging of coincidence and fate.\n\n#Ïù¥Îã¨ÏùòÏÜåÎÖÄ #LOONA #Midnight #MV #BlockBerry #BlockBerryCreative\n\nMore about LOOŒ†Œî/\n\nLOOŒ†Œî Official : http://www.loonatheworld.com\nLOOŒ†Œî Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/loonatheworld/\nLOOŒ†Œî Twitter : https://twitter.com/loonatheworld\nLOOŒ†Œî Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/loonatheworld/\nLOOŒ†Œî Official Korean Fan Cafe : http://cafe.daum.net/loonatheworld\n\nCopyrights 2020 ‚ìí BlockBerryCreative.

        "description": "The 2016 NBA finals gave internet commenters a simple, easy reply for any situation: ‚ÄúThe Warriors blew a 3-1 lead.‚Äù Oh yeah, and it also gave Cleveland its first championship since the ‚Äò60s, quieted LeBron haters, momentarily broke Steph Curry, and gave Kyrie a moment of glory after he had been promised the world and then had to hand that world over to LeBron.  Remember? The Cavs were like ‚Äúsure we‚Äôll build around you Kyrie, you‚Äôre our guy‚Äù and then LeBron said he was coming back to Cleveland, and then the Cavs were like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a Kyrie???‚Äù.\n\nThe 2016 Finals were so good. I mean, it went to seven games, which is exciting enough! But there was so much more! In this video we relive every single part of the series, and everything that lead up to it too ‚Äî from the Warriors‚Äô insane record-setting seasons full of threes to LeBron‚Äôs chasedown blocks to the playoff groin shots. That‚Äôs right, groin shots, plural. Draymond Green was going through a stage.\n\nAnd if you want to chit chat, we have a website dedicated to just that, head on over to https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base.\n\nWritten and produced by: Clara Morris\nDirected and Edited by: Ryan Simmons\n\nSubscribe: https://goo.gl/Nbabae\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRV\nVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFF\nLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7O\nFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02D\nFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFK\nExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com",
